# Productivity App (Full Stack Project)

This project consists of:
- A **React frontend** inside the `client/` directory
- A **Flask backend** inside the `server/` directory

## Getting Started

### 1. Install & Run the Backend
All backend setup (environment, migrations, seeding, and running the API) is documented inside:

**`server/README.md`**

**Please open that file first** for complete installation instructions.

### 2. Install & Run the Frontend
Inside `client/`:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend should automatically communicate with the backend on port **5555**.

## Project Purpose

This full-stack project demonstrates:
- Session-based authentication (Flask)
- Protected API routes
- User-owned resources with validation and pagination
- Clean project structure with clear backend/frontend separation
